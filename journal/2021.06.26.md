**Challenge**
Today was a particularly challenging day. I decided that I would like to write my SQL queries in postgres in such a way that the data will come back from the database formatted the way I would like it. This was really tough, particularly for the styles API which needs to take three columns from one table and reformat them so that each primary key from that column is a key in an object, and the other two columns from the object are themselves in an object that is the value of the primary key.


**Actions**
I tried a few different approaches. One part of the data needed to be an array of objects (the photos), which I was able to use the array_agg and row_to_json methods to quickly accomplish.

The thornier issue has been the object with additional objects within it, particularly dynamically setting the keys to the primary key id of the skus object. I am able to make this sub-query run, but on Monday will need to make it run in the larger context.

I have landed on using the methods json_agg and json_build_object to try to create the object with dynamic keys and nested dynamic objects. The syntax still needs refinement.

**Result**
The subqueries are working as expected, with the notable problem that when they run they retrieve all possible objects associated with the sku primary key id (rather than just for the respective one). I will need to tweak the WHERE statement somehow to prevent that.
