**Challenge**
Today was all about designing the schema for my database. I needed to consider how the entities are related, how the API service will deliver it, and how the raw data is formatted.


**Actions**
I tried to break down the data into the smallest reusable consituent parts. One decision was around features. I had a few options:

1. Keep the raw data format, wherein a feature table has a product id, a feature string, and a value string.
2. Split out each feature/value pair into a separate table and make the feature_product table serve as a join between product and this new feature/value table.
3. Split out feature and value into their own tables, feature_product then becomes a join between three tables: product, feature, and feature_value.

After looking at the number of distict feature and value values in the data I decided to go with options 3.

**Result**

I have my database schema created and will move on to ETL. Performance testing will reveal whether this approach of breaking data down into smaller tables was a good one.
