**Challenge**

Make the postgres db on the host is accessible to the docker containers. To do this I will need to:

1. Make the postgresql listen to an external ip address.
2. Let the docker container access the db with a given user.


**Actions**

On the EC2 instance I updated the postgresql.conf file

> sudo vim /etc/postgresql/13/main/postgresql.conf

Found the line

> #listen_addresses = 'localhost' # what IP address(es) to listen on;

Updated it to

> listen_addresses = '*' # what IP address(es) to listen on;

Then I restarted the db

> /etc/init.d/postgresql restart

Next I needed to give the container access to the database. I opened the pg_hba.conf file to allow this access.

![postgres config](../screenshots/pgconfig1.png)

Added the line

> postgres alexander 172.17.0.0/16 trust



**Result**
