**Challenge**

When I tried to restore my database I got an error that there was not enough disk space for all tables.

**Actions**

I stopped and then terminated the EC2 instance in AWS and created a new one.

![Stop AWS Instance] (../screenshots/aws1.png)

I allocated additional space.

![Add storage] (../screenshots/aws2.png)

And added the security groups I need.

![Security Groups] (../screeshots/aws3.png)

Made the requisite change to the pem file.

> chmod 400 product.pem

Then logged into the secure shell.

> ssh -i product.pem ubuntu@52.14.129.159

**Result**
