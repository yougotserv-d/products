# 2021.06.21 Journal Entry

* Challenge
Today's challenges were primarily around our sprint 0 planning and learning docker.

* Actions
Set up our organization and repository on gitHub and configured our main branches such that they can't be merged without a review first to prevent unwanted changes being pushed. We also created our Trello board and added cards for investigation and research.

With regards to docker, I spent several hours on the Please Contain Yourself training repo (https://github.com/dylanlrrb/Please-Contain-Yourself/tree/master/5-Make_Multiple_Containers_Work_Together) which was a useful introdcution to containers and spinning them up in docker.

* Result
It was a planning day so primarily the result was that our team created the project planning tools we'll use for the rest of this project.

I also learned a lot about docker and spinning up containers. The plan for this project is to use multiple containers for the different services within the API.
